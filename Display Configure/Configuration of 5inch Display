First open the terminal and type 

Sudo nano /boot/config.txt

hdmi_group = 2
hdmi_ mode = 87
hdmi_cvt 800 480 60 6 0 0 0

#### Touch Configuration ####

Open www.waveshare.com/wiki/5inch_HDMI_LCD

At the bottom of this page in resources there will be an image with LCD-shoe-xxxxxx.tar.gz
Download it and extract it by 

cd /home/pi/downloads
sudo tar xvf filename.tar.gz
cd filename/
sudo ./LCD5-show

After this pi will automatically reboot

After reboot open terminal 

go to cd/home/pi/Downloads/LCD-show(filename)
sudo dpkg -i xinput-calibrator_0.7.5-1_armhf.deb

We're done :)

close terminal, open menu->preferences->calibrate touchscreen(I will prefer calibrate it v=by stylus as it doesn't have very sensitive touch because of being resistive touch.)
